%Relation to gimble position

The purpose of the server is to receive image data from the rover, produce a 3D environment from it, and feed back control inputs from the user. This is all done within the framework of the 3D game engine Unreal Engine 4 \cite{unreal}. Unreal 4 was chosen because it provides easy interfacing with almost any VR headset on the market without large rewrites of the code, it is simple to integrate with OpenCV, and is free to use.
